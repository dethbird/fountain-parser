FADE IN:

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Morning traffic hums. The patio is crowded with laptop people and latte foam art influencers.

JANE sits at a small table, typing on her laptop. A half-empty cappuccino stares back, cooling with existential dread.

JANE
(looking up from screen)
I think I've got it!

She closes the laptop with satisfaction and breathes, as if exhaling an entire week.

= Jane finishes draft zero; new goal: share it

A BARISTA rattles cups inside. A passing BUSKER strums the same three chords, but with heart.

JANE
(to herself)
No more caveats. Time to ship.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Inside is a mild chaos symphony: grinder, milk steamer, printer whining from the back.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY, 30s, tech casual, leans on the counter pretending the pastry case is interesting.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Hey—did the ending finally behave?

JANE
I wrangled it into submission.

(beat)

JANE
Not pretty, but readable.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Readability's ninety percent of pretty.

FADE OUT.

INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

A whiteboard groans under diagrams. Sticky notes form a fractal of optimism.

JANE
We'll keep the parser incremental. No full rescans.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
(gesturing at the board)
And the preview goes worker-side. Deltas, not dumps.

JANE
Exactly.

@Mentor
(from speakerphone)
Ship something imperfect. Perfect is a direction, not a state.

.MONTAGE – CODING AND COFFEE

— Keys clack.  
— Tests blink green, then red, then righteous green again.  
— A PROGRESS BAR hesitates, then slides home.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JANE'S DOOR - NIGHT

DAVE^
(whisper-shouting)
I brought snacks and feature creep!

JANE^
(whisper-shouting back)
Only if the snacks pass code review!

DONNY^
(off)
bees!

JANE
(confused)
Why bees?

DONNY
I thought we were yelling nouns.

Laughter. The tension snaps.

= Comic relief; team cohesion increases

>INTERMISSION<

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

City lights blink like patient cursors. The air tastes like rain and new commits.

JANE
We need a title page that actually looks like a title page.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
And margins that would make old-school script readers nod with dignified approval.

JANE
(considering)
Courier Prime, 12pt. One-inch all around, inch-and-a-half left where it matters.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Heads turn when pagination doesn't.

CUT TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

The launch screen glows on a modest laptop. JANE hovers the cursor over a big, friendly button.

JANE
(to everyone)
Moment of truth.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Ship it.

JANE clicks.

The app compiles, deploys, and returns with a humble little toast: "It worked."

= Milestone: first user-visible success

JANE
(relieved)
Okay. Bugs tomorrow.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Bugs are just misunderstood features.

DAVE
(sincerely)
We're proud of you.

# Act
The Act of Consequences (Reprise)

## Scene
Feedback and Fallout

### Sequence
Users Arrive

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

Regulars scroll through their phones. Someone discovers the app, squints, then grins.

USER #1
(softly, to self)
This feels fast.

USER #2
overhears, nodding with quiet internet approval

INT. COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

A NOTIFICATION pings—just shy of obnoxious. JANE reads.

JANE
(reading)
"Love the live preview. Could you add inline notes to the PDF?"

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
We tabled PDF. For now.

JANE
(typing a reply)
Roadmap: yes. Priority: after stability.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
(aside)
We're maintaining a boundary. That's growth.

= They choose focus; future them says thanks

[[ Note for later:
Revisit pagination widows/orphans; test five-page dialogues.
Consider keep-with-next for scene headers.
]]

INT. WHITEBOARD NOOK - LATER

@QA
(cheerful)
Found a weird edge case: dot-slug headings inside notes become haunted.

JANE
(jots it down)
Haunted slugs go to the backlog.

CUT TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON

Wind through leaves. The world continues, blissfully unaware of issue trackers.

JANE
I forgot what sunlight felt like.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Sunlight: a free, high-availability mood service.

JANE
(smiles)
Let's ship a tiny thing every day.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Agile via nice weather.

FADE OUT.

# Appendix
Assorted Scratch and Sections

## Themes
Growth through deliberate constraint.

### Open Questions
What is "done" when words keep moving?

#### Panel: Demo Checklist

[a]https://example.com/audio/subtle-whoosh.mp3
- Intro under 90 seconds
- Show typing → preview
- Kill the spinner ASAP
= Demo flow: cold open → payoff

> SMASH TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

The team watches metrics. A few people in distant rooms clap without being asked.

JANE
We can sleep now.

BOB O'SHAUNNESSY
Tomorrow we build the PDF thing. Maybe.

DAVE
Or never. Kidding. Kind of.

FADE TO BLACK.
