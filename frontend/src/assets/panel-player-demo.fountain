The city glows. WIND moves across concrete like a patient tide.

= Establishes mood and location

#### Panel 2: Jane on the ledge

JANE leans on the parapet, phone in hand, eyes tracking the street below.

JANE
(softly)
Okay. One small scene at a time.

#### Panel 3: Incoming text

Her phone buzzes. A text from BOB: “ready when you are”.

## Scene 2: Workspace — Night
### Sequence B: The Plan

A whiteboard crammed with beats, arrows, and a big circled word: “PANELS”.

JANE
We anchor everything on panel duration. No more drift.

#### Panel 5: Player UI close-up
00:09

The prototype media controls blink to life: ▶︎, ⏸, ⏭, a progress ring.

= UX beat: confirm basic controls are visible

#### Panel 6: First playback test
00:11

JANE
Count with me. Eleven seconds. Panels should snap to the next clip without a hitch.

BOB
(confident)
No frame gaps. Promise.

[[ Inline note: Watch transition between panel 6→7 for timing jitter ]]

### Sequence C: Momentum

#### Panel 7: Coffee steam / tempo up
00:06

Steam curls. Keyboard chatter ramps. The team hits stride.

#### Panel 8: Dual dialogue dry run
00:10

JANE^
BOB^
(whispering)
Testing simultaneous cues.

JANE
You take timing, I take rendering.

BOB
And we meet in the middle.

= Dual cue sanity check

# Act II
## Scene 3: Street — Night
### Sequence D: Field Test

#### Panel 9: Exterior cutaway
00:08

Rain stipples the asphalt. Neon reflects like liquid code.

#### Panel 10: Voice memo overlay

JANE (V.O.)
If a panel has both image and audio, play both, then display this content as the panel’s script.

- Verify audio fades under 250ms
- Verify image stays until duration completes

#### Panel 11: Audio-only resilience
00:05
[a]https://www.soundjay.com/button/sounds/button-26.mp3
The image is intentionally omitted here. The panel should still run for five seconds and render this text.

= Edge case: audio-only panel

#### Panel 12: Image-only resilience
00:05
[i]https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1481277542470-605612bd2d61?w=1600
Silence. Only the image remains while the caption breathes under it.

= Edge case: image-only panel

## Scene 4: Back at the workspace — Late night
### Sequence E: Polishing

#### Panel 13: Centered break
00:04
[i]https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1469474968028-56623f02e42e?w=1600
>INTERMISSION<
A brief visual beat. You can still render centered text after media finishes.

#### Panel 14: Lyrics test
00:08

~ “we debug by moonlight”
~ “refactor at dawn”
A soft chorus under a still frame.

#### Panel 15: Notes inline
00:06

Some action here [[with an inline note]] continues. Notes should not block playback.

# Act III
## Scene 5: Launch — Morning
### Sequence F: Ship It

#### Panel 16: Countdown
00:05

Numbers cascade on screen. Fingers hover over Enter.

#### Panel 17: Ship
00:07

Ship it.

JANE
(smiles)
Ship it.

[a]https://www.soundjay.com/button/sounds/button-3.mp3
A tiny toast appears: “It worked.” Everyone exhales.

= End beat: relief, not fireworks

FADE OUT.
